Your task is to choose the best {} or more clips from the list above and write a short description of why 
each clip was chosen over the others. Make sure to choose clips that will keep a viewer engaged.
Once you have chosen your clips you should format your choices into a list. Each. For example:

(0, 5, 8)

This is just an example, you should choose the clips you think are best
here are some rules for choosing clips:
1) choose the clip that will keep the viewer engaged, clips with alot of action are good
2) choose clips that are going to be funny out of context (if possible)
3) make sure the reasoning for choosing the clip is clear and concise if not do not choose the clip
4) do not choose boring clips (if you are bored reading it the viewer will be bored watching it)
5) longer clips are better than shorter clips (if possible)
6) do not choose clips that seem to be singing any song (this is a legal issue) 
7) finally use your best judgement and make sure to be thoughtful in your choices
