Transcripts: {}

Titles: {}

Streamer info: {}

Above is the name and transcript of one or more clips of the twitch streamer called {}. 
There is also some info about the streamer. Use this info to complete the task.
Make sure to include a title, description, and tags in the following format:

"Title: your answer here
 Description: your answer here
 Tags: your answer here"

The description must be quite short just a small description of the video. 
The tags must be a comma separated list. 
Do not add anything to the title other than the hook to bring the viewer in as this is done automatic afterwards. 
With that being said make sure the title is short and to the point and maximize click through rate and viewer retension. 
A few more rules: 
1) do not title the video "clip compilation" or "funny moments" that will not maximixe click through rate. instead bait the viewer with a title that will make them want to click. 
2) make the title related to something that occured in the transcript do not speculate.
3) do not use names provided in the transcript instead use the streamers name.
4) do not add any post fix to the title such as "clip compilation" or "funny moments" or "best of" or anything like that.
